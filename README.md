## Gameplay 
The bottom paddle is controlled using the 'a' and 'd' keys, while the right paddle is controlled using the 'j' and 'l' arrow keys. The ball initially starts in the center of the screen and moves at a random angle. When a player misses the ball, the game pauses briefly, then the ball resets to the center of the screen and the players continue playing until one player reaches a score of 5, at which point the game ends and the winner is declared. Overall, Pong is a classic and straightforward game that tests players' reaction time and hand-eye coordination, and it is a remix of the og classic.

## Code
This is a Python code for a ping-pong game using Pygame library. The code initializes the necessary variables and objects required to create the game window and display the game elements such as paddles, ball, score, and game menu. It also defines functions for calculating the distance between two points and playing sounds for the game. The code also implements a countdown sound effect and music that can be played throughout the game. The game itself is a two-player game with one player controlling the paddle on the bottom of the screen, and the other player controlling the paddle at the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth between the two paddles without letting it fall off the screen. If the ball hits the opponent's paddle, the opponent loses a point. The game ends when one of the players reaches a certain number of points. There are also two additional game modes implemented in the code - an AI mode where the player competes against a computer-controlled opponent, and a two-player mode where two human players compete against each other. These game modes can be selected from the game menu.
